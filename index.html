          Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a British-born computer scientist who is credited for inventing the World Wide Web (a.k.a WWW).
          Tim originally created the World Wide Web in 1989 for Univerities and other institutes to use as a tool for automated
          information sharing.
          The invention of the World Wide Web was one of the most significant advancements in the internet's history, and
          essentially created the way information is shared today.
          After creating the Web, Berners-Lee also created the first web browser called WorldWideWeb (later renamed to Nexus) in
          1990, which was essentially the only way to view the web.
          Tim later became the co-founder of his own company, Inrupt, which helps develop an open source program called Solid.
